# My Web Portfolio
This is the beginning of my web portfolio in pure HTML/CSS coded from scratch with no outside library other than utilizing some Font Awesome icons for footer navigation. There are various hover animations for the nav bar, portfolio flex boxes, contact submission button and around the web footer links. Media queries were used so it will be responsive on mobile devices.
